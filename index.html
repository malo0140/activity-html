    <h1> Alice: Madness Returns </h1>
    
        <p>Eleven years ago a horrific fire took Alice's family from her and left her mind horrifically scarred. Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge Asylum, where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping further into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has finally secured her releaseâ€”yet she still bears the heavy psychological burden of that tragic event.</p>
